# Jotta

Jotta is a barebones Node.js server which uses the Express framework. It exists to get a simple express implementation up and running super duper quick. It can be quickly deployed to Heroku following the instructions below (adapted from the [Heroku documentation for implementing Node.js](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs).

Jotta works very well with [Squared Paper](http://github.com/jeshuamaxey/squared-paper), a front end amalgam of boilerplate code.

## Running Jotta Locally

### Prerequisites

I am assuming you have Node.js installed locally on your machine. If you do not, you can download it [here](http://nodejs.org/download).

### Running the server

Navigate to the Jotta directory in a terminal window and run the following command:
```
node index.js
```
By default, the server runs at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Deploying to Heroku

### Prerequisites

As well as all the prerequisites of the previous section, I am assuming you have the Heroku toolbelt installed on your machine and have signed up for a free Heroku account. Details of this can be found on the [heroku website](http://heroku.com).

### Deploying the server
